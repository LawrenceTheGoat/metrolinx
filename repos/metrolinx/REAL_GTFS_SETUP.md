# Real GTFS Data Integration Guide

## Overview

Your Metrolinx Voice Query App now uses **real GO Transit schedule data** from the official GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) files. This means you can get actual train schedules, station information, and route details for the GO Transit system.

## What's New

### Real Schedule Data
- **Actual departure and arrival times** from GO Transit GTFS data
- **Real station names and codes** (Union Station, Oriole GO, etc.)
- **Current route information** for all GO lines (Lakeshore East, Richmond Hill, etc.)
- **Intelligent station name matching** for voice recognition

### Enhanced Voice Queries
The app now understands natural language queries like:
- "When is the next train from Union Station to Oriole?"
- "What are the next departures from Scarborough GO?"
- "Train from Richmond Hill to downtown"
- "Schedule from Ajax to Union Station"

## How It Works

### 1. GTFS Data Processing
The system loads and processes four key GTFS files:
- `stops.txt` - All GO Transit stations
- `routes.txt` - Train lines and bus routes
- `trips.txt` - Individual trip information
- `stop_times.txt` - Detailed schedule data

### 2. Smart Station Recognition
The app includes extensive station aliases:
```javascript
// Examples of recognized station names:
'union' → Union Station
'oriole' → Oriole GO
'scarborough' → Scarborough GO
'downtown' → Union Station
'airport' → Pearson Airport
```

### 3. Real-Time Processing
- Filters out past departures
- Shows next available trains
- Calculates travel duration
- Provides route information

## Voice Query Examples

### Schedule Between Stations
**Say:** "Union Station to Oriole"
**Response:** "The next train from Union Station to Oriole GO departs at 2:15 PM and arrives at 2:45 PM. Travel time is 30 minutes on the Richmond Hill line."

### Next Departures
**Say:** "Next trains from Scarborough GO"
**Response:** "Next departures from Scarborough GO: 2:10 PM on LE, 2:25 PM on LE, 2:40 PM on LE."

### Station Information
**Say:** "Tell me about Oriole station"
**Response:** "I found Oriole GO. You can ask me about schedules from this station or to other destinations."

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files
1. **`gtfs-parser.js`** - Processes GTFS data files
2. **`real-gtfs-api.js`** - Handles voice queries and responses
3. **Updated `app.js`** - Integrates with new API

### Data Loading Process
```javascript
// The system automatically loads GTFS data on first use
const realGTFSAPI = new RealGTFSAPI();
await realGTFSAPI.initialize(); // Loads all GTFS files
```

### Station Matching Algorithm
1. **Exact alias match** - "union" → "UN" station code
2. **Partial name match** - "scarborough" matches "Scarborough GO"
3. **Fuzzy matching** - Handles variations in pronunciation

## Supported Stations

The system recognizes all GO Transit stations including:

### Major Hubs
- Union Station (downtown Toronto)
- Bloor GO
- Pearson Airport
- Square One (Mississauga)

### Lakeshore East Line
- Scarborough GO, Danforth GO, Guildwood GO
- Rouge Hill GO, Pickering GO, Ajax GO
- Whitby GO, Oshawa GO

### Richmond Hill Line
- Oriole GO, Old Cummer GO, Langstaff GO
- Richmond Hill GO, Gormley GO, Bloomington GO

### Barrie Line
- Downsview Park GO, Rutherford GO, Maple GO
- King City GO, Aurora GO, Newmarket GO
- East Gwillimbury GO, Bradford GO, Barrie South GO

### And many more...

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- **Station not found**: "I couldn't find the station 'xyz'. Please try the full station name."
- **No direct routes**: "You might need to transfer at Union Station or another hub."
- **No upcoming trains**: "Sorry, I couldn't find any upcoming departures."

## Performance Features

### Efficient Data Loading
- GTFS files are loaded once and cached in memory
- Fast station lookup using Maps and aliases
- Optimized schedule searching algorithms

### Smart Filtering
- Only shows future departures
- Sorts results by departure time
- Limits results to prevent information overload

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time delays** - Integration with GO Transit's real-time API
2. **Service alerts** - Notifications about disruptions
3. **Fare calculation** - Actual fare information
4. **Platform information** - Specific platform numbers
5. **Accessibility info** - Elevator status, accessible routes

### Data Updates
- GTFS data should be updated regularly (weekly/monthly)
- New stations and schedule changes will be automatically supported
- The system is designed to handle GTFS format changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Station not found" errors:**
- Try using the full station name: "Scarborough GO" instead of "Scarborough"
- Use common aliases: "Union Station" or just "Union"
- Check spelling in voice recognition

**No schedule results:**
- Verify both stations are on the GO Transit network
- Some routes may require transfers
- Check if you're asking during service hours

**Loading errors:**
- Ensure GTFS files are in the correct `/GO-GTFS/` directory
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify all required files are present

### Debug Information
The system logs detailed information to the browser console:
```
Loading GTFS data...
Loaded 67 stops, 45 routes, 15234 stop times
Finding schedule from Union Station (UN) to Oriole GO (OR)
```

## Data Sources

- **GTFS Data**: Official Metrolinx/GO Transit GTFS feed
- **Station Information**: GO Transit official station list
- **Route Data**: Current GO Transit route network
- **Schedule Data**: Real timetables from GO Transit

This integration provides your voice app with accurate, up-to-date transit information that users can rely on for their daily commute and travel planning.
